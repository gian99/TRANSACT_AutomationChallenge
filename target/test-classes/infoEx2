 Task 2 - API Automated test using
Given the following web-services:
https://api.countrylayer.com/v2/all
https://api.countrylayer.com/v2/alpha/{code}
To get the API Key you can sign up to this site https://countrylayer.com/documentation
Please create the following automated test scenarios:
- Get each country (US, DE and GB) individually and validate the response
- Try to get information for inexistent countries and validate the response
- Write a test that would validate new country addition using POST(it will not work,
 since it does not have a POST method available, but try).
Example of json body for POST is below:
 {
    name: "US",
    alpha2_code: "TC",
    alpha3_code: "TCY"
 }
Tip: Do not forget to validate the response codes!
