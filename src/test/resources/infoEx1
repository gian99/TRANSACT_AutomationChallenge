 Considerations:
• Use your language of preference (bonus for Python).
• Add the task to your personal GitHub with all the information required
for us to run and validate it.
• We set a deadline for returning the test within the next days (Due date: 08/05 - 11:59 pm)
Evaluation Criteria:
1. The tests pass stably and follow described cases.
2. The solution is well and logically organized.
3. The code is documented and is easy to-follow.
4. The application is supplied with all the information required for
us to run and validate it as well as a description and purpose of used additional libraries.
Your solution can include:
- Encapsulation layers like test data, logic of tests, actions on web pages and so on;
- Generating random values for insignificant test data, for example, for new user, etc.
